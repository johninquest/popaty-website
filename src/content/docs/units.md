# Units

Units let you organize multi-unit properties (apartments, townhouses, etc.). For single-unit properties, you can skip this step.

## Add a Unit

1. Open a property
2. In the **"Units"** card, click **"Add Unit"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Unit Number:** Required (e.g., "A1", "101")
   - **Unit Name:** Optional descriptive name (e.g., "Ground Floor Left")
4. Click **"Add"**

## View a Unit

1. Click **"View"** next to any unit in the list
2. You'll see unit details and assigned tenants

## Edit a Unit

1. View the unit details page
2. Click **"Edit"**
3. Update the unit number or name
4. Click **"Save"**

## Delete a Unit

1. View the unit details page
2. Click **"Delete Unit"**
3. Confirm the deletion

> **Note:** Deleting a unit doesn't delete tenants assigned to it, but they'll show "—" for their unit assignment.
