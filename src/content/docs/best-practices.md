# Tips & Best Practices

Follow these recommendations to get the most out of Popaty.

## Naming and Organization

### Use Descriptive Names

- Name properties and units clearly so they're easy to identify
- Example: "Sunrise Apartments - Building A" instead of just "Building A"

### Organize by Location

- Use consistent naming conventions for multiple properties
- Include city or neighborhood names if you manage properties in different areas

## Recording Data

### Record Rent Promptly

- Log payments as soon as you receive them
- This keeps your records accurate and up-to-date
- Makes month-end reconciliation easier

### Use the Notes Field

- Add context to rent entries and expenses for future reference
- Example: "Partial payment - remaining $200 due next week"
- Helps you remember special circumstances

## Managing Tenants

### Keep Tenant Info Updated

- Accurate contact information helps prevent issues
- Update phone numbers and preferred names when they change
- Keep track of which unit each tenant occupies

### Don't Delete, Deactivate

- Mark tenants as **Inactive** instead of deleting
- Preserves rent history and records
- You can always see past payment patterns

## Access Management

### Grant Appropriate Access

- Give people only the access level they need
- Use **Viewer** for accountants or stakeholders who just need to see data
- Use **Manager** for assistants or team members who handle day-to-day tasks

### Review Access Regularly

- Check the **Shared Access** section periodically
- Revoke access for people who no longer need it
- Update roles if responsibilities change

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Review Activity Logs

- Check who's accessing and modifying your properties
- Use the Activity tab to track changes
- Filter by date range to investigate specific periods

### Regular Data Reviews

- Monthly: Review all rent entries for completeness
- Quarterly: Check expense categories for budgeting
- Annually: Update property information (construction year, etc.)

## Data Entry

### Be Consistent

- Use the same payment method names (e.g., always "Bank Transfer" not sometimes "Wire")
- Standardize vendor names for expenses
- Keep category selections consistent

### Add Details Early

- Fill in optional fields when you have the information
- It's easier to add details now than to find them later
- Complete records make reporting more valuable

## Backup Strategy

### Export Regularly

- Take screenshots of important summary views
- Keep external records of critical tenant contracts
- Document custom arrangements in the notes fields

## Common Workflows

### New Property Setup

1. Create the property
2. Add all units (if multi-unit)
3. Add current tenants
4. Grant access to your team
5. Record current month's rent

### Monthly Rent Collection

1. Use the **Record Rent** quick action from dashboard
2. Record payments as they come in
3. Review the Rent Entries tab for any missing payments
4. Follow up with tenants who haven't paid

### Expense Tracking

1. Record expenses immediately
2. Attach vendor information
3. Use consistent categories
4. Review monthly totals for budgeting
