# Sharing Properties (Access Management)

Only property owners can share properties with others.

## Grant Access to Another User

2. Scroll to the **"Shared Access"** section (visible on the Overview tab)
3. See the current list of people with access
4. Click the blue **"Grant Access"** button (top-right of the card)
5. In the modal that opens:
   - **Enter email:** Type the person's Gmail address
   - **Select access level:**
     - **Viewer:** Can see everything but cannot make changes
     - **Manager:** Can view and edit tenants, units, rent entries, and expenses
6. Click **"Grant Access"**

### What Happens Next
