# Permission Levels Explained

Popaty uses a three-tier permission system to control who can access and modify your properties.

## Owner

**You created the property**

### What Owners Can Do

- Full control: create, view, edit, delete everything
- Share the property with others
- Grant and revoke access
- Change access levels for other users
- Delete the property

### Important Notes

- Cannot be removed (you always own what you created)
- Only owners can share properties with others

## Manager

**Granted by the property owner**

### What Managers Can Do

- View and edit:
  - Property details
  - Units
  - Tenants
  - Rent entries
  - Expenses
- Add new items (units, tenants, rent entries, expenses)
- Delete items they have access to

### What Managers Cannot Do

- Share the property with others
- Delete the property
- Grant or revoke access
- Change access levels

## Viewer

**Granted by the property owner**

### What Viewers Can Do

- View (read-only):
  - Property details
  - Units
  - Tenants
  - Rent entries
  - Expenses
  - Activity logs

### What Viewers Cannot Do

- Make any changes
- Add, edit, or delete anything
- Share the property
- Grant or revoke access

## Activity Tracking

Every action is tracked for transparency and accountability:

- View activity logs in the **Activity** tab of any property
- See who did what and when
- Track changes to property data
- Filter by date range (default: last 30 days)

## Best Practices

- **Grant appropriate access:** Give people only the access level they need
- **Use Manager for team members:** People who need to update tenant info and record payments
- **Use Viewer for stakeholders:** People who need to see data but shouldn't make changes
- **Review activity logs regularly:** Check who's accessing and modifying your properties
