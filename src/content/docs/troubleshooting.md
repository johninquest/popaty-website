## Specific Feature Issues

### Can't Delete Something

**Possible reasons:**

### Can't Grant Access

**Problem:** Unable to share property with others

**Possible causes:**

- You're not the property owner (only owners can share)

- Double-check the email address is a valid Gmail
- Check the Shared Access list for existing entries
