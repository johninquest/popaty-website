Keep tenant info updated: Accurate contact information helps prevent issues
Use the notes field: Add context to rent entries and expenses for future reference
Review activity logs: Check who's accessing and modifying your properties
Grant appropriate access: Give people only the access level they need
Don't delete, deactivate: Mark tenants as inactive instead of deleting to preserve rent history
